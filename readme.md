## Introduction

One of the great features of Rainlab Pages plugin is the `Snippets` feature. It allows the developer to hand over management of complex items, such as forms, maps, widgets, etc to the client. For more information on what a Snippet is, please see https://github.com/rainlab/pages-plugin#snippets.

This plugin simply extends the ability to re-use these snippets from any `richeditor` by providing an additional dropdown to the Froala Richeditor with a list of available snippets (supports partial and component based snippets). It also provides a twig filter to allow the parsing of implemented snippets.

For documentation regarding creating snippets, please see https://github.com/rainlab/pages-plugin#snippets-created-from-partials
